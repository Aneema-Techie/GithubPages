# Diwali Sales Analysis - Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to "DiwaliSalesDataAnalysis" – a comprehensive data analysis project exploring Diwali sales trends, customer demographics, and regional insights.  
This project is proudly featured on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Aneema-Techie) and showcases my skills in data analytics, visualization, and Python programming.

#Project Overview

"DiwaliSalesDataAnalysis" analyzes real-world sales data from the Diwali festival period, focusing on:

- "Customer Segmentation": Gender, Age Group, Marital Status
- "Geographical Insights": State-wise Sales & Orders
- "Product & Category Performance"
- "Visualizations": Matplotlib & Seaborn

# Repository Structure

- `D_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with all analysis, data cleaning, and visualizations.
- `Diwali Sales Data.csv` — Sample sales dataset (not included for privacy, but structure described in the notebook).
- `README.md` — Project documentation (you are here!).

# Key Findings

- "Females" have higher purchasing power and order frequency.
- "Age group 26-35" (especially females) are the most active buyers.
- "Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka" lead in total sales and order volume.
- "Marital Status" and other demographic factors play key roles in sales trends.
